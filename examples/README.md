# elm-element: Examples
## Instructions
+ ```npm run install```
+ ```npm run {example_name}```

## Notes
+ The examples above use [Parcel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel) for importing Elm files directly into JavaScript code. There are [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-webpack-loader) and [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-elm) alternatives that can be used the same way.
+ All examples make use of ```webcomponents-bundle``` from [@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs]() polyfill for simplicity. There are be better and more performatic ways to do so depending on your browser requirements and setup. Read the polyfill documentation for more details.
